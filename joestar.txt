No matter...
No matter what Dio is about to do to my body down below,
you must never get enraged and lose your cool, Jotaro.
Don't worry about me anymore.
This happened because it had to happen.
Kakyoin solved the mystery of Dio's stand.
I relayed his message to you.
If we had all fought Dio at once, we would have all perished instantly.
You've become able to move a bit within stopped time.
You have two or three seconds now...
Use that time wisely.
No matter what Dio does now, you mustn't get angry.
If you fly into a rage and strike first, you'll only put yourself in a bad situation.
Jotaro...
This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?
So much happened.
I swear...
These fifty days really were fun.
